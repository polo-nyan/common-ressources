### Pride Flags

A json list of mostly common pride flags.  
This is a work in progress and will be updated as I find more flags or need them for my own projects. 
The flags are stored in a json file with information like, name, description, and flag colors description.  
No images are included, but an example php code is provided to display the flags.
